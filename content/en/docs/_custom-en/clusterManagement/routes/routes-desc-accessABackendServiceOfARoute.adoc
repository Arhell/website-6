This section describes how to access the backend service of an Ingress.

After the Ingress is created, you can access the backend service of the Ingress through any HTTP or HTTPS client. Depending on the external access mode of the cluster gateway or project gateway, you can use the following access methods:

* If the external access mode of the cluster gateway or project gateway is NodePort, you can access the backend service of the Ingress through the domain name, path, and port number (e.g., **example.com/test:30240**).

* If the external access mode of the cluster gateway or project gateway is LoadBalancer, you can access the backend service of the Ingress through the domain name and path (e.g., **example.com/test**).

The following only demonstrates how to test whether the Ingress is set correctly in the {ks_product-en} web console.
