This section describes how to manage volume snapshots and volume snapshot contents.

A volume snapshot defines the storage resources required to save snapshot data. After a volume snapshot is created, the system will save the snapshot data in the backend storage system, and each unit of snapshot data corresponds to a volume snapshot content on the {ks_product-en} platform.
