|Parameter |Description

|Protocol
|The protocol that the application in the target container actually listens on.

|Name
|The name of the service port.

|Container Port
|The port number that the application in the target container actually listens on. If using the example container image `registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/kse/spring-cloud-gateway:latest`, set the container port number to **8080**.

|Parameter |Description

|NodePort
|The system maps the node's port to the service port, and the service can be accessed via the node's IP address and node port.

|LoadBalancer
|The system allocates an external IP address to the service on top of the NodePort service and binds the external IP address to an external load balancer. The external load balancer listens on the node port corresponding to the service, so the service can be accessed via the external IP address. To achieve this functionality, the service in the LoadBalancer type requires load balancer plugins and infrastructure environment support, and relevant annotations need to be set. For more information, contact your infrastructure environment provider.
