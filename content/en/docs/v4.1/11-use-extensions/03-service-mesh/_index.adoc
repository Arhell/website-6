This section describes how to use the "KubeSphere Service Mesh" extension.

KubeSphere Service Mesh is used to enable the service mesh functionality of KubeSphere, built on the open-source project Istio, and visualizes microservice governance and traffic management. It has a powerful toolkit, including circuit breakers, blue-green deployments, canary releases, traffic mirroring, tracing, observability, and traffic control.

After installing the "KubeSphere Service Mesh" extension, **Service Mesh** will be displayed in the project's left navigation pane, supporting creating composed apps and managing grayscale releases for composed apps.
