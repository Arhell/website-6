This section describes how to use the grayscale release feature.

When a container version needs to be updated, directly releasing a new version without sufficient testing to the production environment may pose significant risks to the business. Using the grayscale release feature, the business traffic in the production environment is forwarded to the new version being tested, thereby fully exposing and promptly fixing potential issues in the new version before its official release.

KubeSphere supports the following grayscale release modes:

* Blue-Green Deployment: Sends business traffic to the new version for testing. If the new version does not function normally, the business traffic can be immediately switched back to the old version.

* Canary Release: Allocates business traffic to both the new and old versions according to a certain ratio, ensuring business continuity while testing the new version.

* Traffic Mirroring: Sends a copy of the business traffic to the new version for testing without actually exposing the new version.
