This section describes how to use the "KubeSphere Ingress Utils" extension. After installation, only {ks_product-en} platform administrators and cluster administrators who have installed the extension can use this extension.

The "KubeSphere Ingress Utils" provides several practical extended capabilities for Ingresses, such as domain reuse validation, aimed at enhancing the global management of Ingresses.

After adding the domain names that need to be restricted for reuse, workspace users will not be able to use the same domain name to create Ingresses in different projects, to avoid mutual influence between Ingresses, thereby preventing business errors.

Before installing the "KubeSphere Ingress Utils" extension, the "KubeSphere Gateway" extension must be installed first.

After installing the "KubeSphere Ingress Utils" extension, the **Ingress Utils** option will be displayed under the **Application Workloads** menu in the left navigation pane of the cluster.
