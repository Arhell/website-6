This section describes how to edit domain information.

You can edit the description of the domain. KubeSphere does not support editing the name and domain of an already added domain.

== Prerequisites

* **KubeSphere Ingress Utils** should have been installed and enabled.

* You should have the **cluster-admin** role on the {ks_product-en} platform.

== Steps

. Log in to the {ks_product-en} web console with a user who has the **cluster-admin** role and enter your cluster.
