This section describes how to use the "KubeSphere Multi-Cluster Agent Connection" extension for agent connections between clusters.

The component Tower of KubeSphere is used for agent connection. Tower is a tool for network connection between clusters through the agent. If the host cluster cannot access the member cluster directly, you can expose the proxy service address of the host cluster. This enables the member cluster to connect to the host cluster through the agent. This method is applicable when the member cluster is in a private environment (for example, IDC) and the host cluster is able to expose the proxy service. The agent connection is also applicable when your clusters are distributed across different cloud providers.

After installing the "KubeSphere Multi-Cluster Agent Connection" extension on the host cluster, a service named `tower` will be automatically created in the system project `kubesphere-system`. Through this service, member clusters can be added through agent connection.
