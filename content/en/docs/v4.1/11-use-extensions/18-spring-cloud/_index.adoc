This section describes how to use the KubeSphere Spring Cloud extension.

The KubeSphere Spring Cloud extension provides microservices, microservice configuration, and microservice gateway features. The microservice registration and configuration functions are implemented based on link:https://nacos.io[Nacos], and the microservice gateway is implemented based on Spring Cloud Gateway. If your existing application conforms to the Nacos specification, KubeSphere Spring Cloud can help you get the operation and maintenance efficiency of containerized applications while keeping the original framework unchanged.

After installing the KubeSphere Spring Cloud extension, the **Spring Cloud** option will be displayed in the left navigation pane of the project.
