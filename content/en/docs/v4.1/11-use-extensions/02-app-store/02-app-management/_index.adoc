In KubeSphere, an application refers to a business program composed of one or more workloads, services, Ingresses, etc. Application templates in KubeSphere is based on Helm, defining the application's orchestration through Helm Chart.

You can create an application template in a workspace that contains one or more application versions (each version defined by a Helm Chart), thereby installing the applications defined in the application template in the projects of the workspace.
