This section describes how to manage app repositories on the {ks_product-en} platform.

Add Helm Chart repositories as app repositories to the {ks_product-en} platform, so that users can install apps from these repositories across all projects. For information on how to create a Helm Chart repository, see the link:https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/[Helm Documentation].
