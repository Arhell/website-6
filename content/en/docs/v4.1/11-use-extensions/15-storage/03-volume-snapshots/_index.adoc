If you did not specify an external persistent storage system when installing {ks_product-en}, KubeSphere will use the local storage system of the cluster nodes as the persistent storage system. Typically, the local storage system of cluster nodes does not support volume snapshot functionality. 

Before creating a volume snapshot, you need to install a storage plugin for clusters to ensure that the backend storage system supports volume snapshot functionality, and create a link:../04-volume-snapshot-classes/01-create-a-volume-snapshot-class[Volume Snapshot Class].
