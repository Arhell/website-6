This section describes how to manage volume snapshot classes.

A volume snapshot class defines a class of volume snapshots that can be used by containers. Before creating a volume snapshot class, please install a storage plugin for the KubeSphere cluster and ensure that the backend storage system supports volume snapshot functionality. For more information, contact your storage system provider.
