This section describes how to use the "KubeSphere Storage" extension.

This extension includes multiple storage-related utilities:

* snapshot-controller: Used to create snapshots for PVCs.
* snapshotclass-controller: Used to count snapshots.
* pvc-auto-resizer: Used to automatically expand PVCs when they are running out of capacity.
* storageclass-accessor: Provides an admission controller to verify whether it is allowed to create PVCs in a specific namespace or workspace.


After installing the "KubeSphere Storage" extension,

* The **Storage** menu in the left navigation pane of the cluster will display **Volume Snapshots** and **Volume Snapshot Classes** options, and **Storage Classes** will support **Set Authorization Rules** and **Set Auto Expansion**.
* The **Storage** menu in the left navigation pane of the project will display the **Volume Snapshots** option.

|
* The auto-expansion feature of storage classes supports automatically expanding PVCs when they are running out of capacity. It only controls whether users are allowed to use the related operations in the {ks_product-en} web console. Whether the storage class actually supports these operations depends on the backend storage system.
* Setting auto-expansion requires connecting to the prometheus service. For more information, see the details page of the "KubeSphere Storage" extension in the Extensions Center.
