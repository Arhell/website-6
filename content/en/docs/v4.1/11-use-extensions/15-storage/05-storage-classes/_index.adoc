This section describes how to set authorization rules and auto-expansion for storage classes.

After installing the "KubeSphere Storage" extension, the **Storage Classes** in the cluster will support **Set Authorization Rules** and **Set Auto Expansion**.

* Set Authorization Rules: Users can only use the storage class in specific projects and workspaces.

* Set Auto Expansion: The system automatically expands the volume capacity when the remaining space is below a threshold.
