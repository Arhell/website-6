Cert Manager creates TLS certificates for workloads in Kubernetes and renews them before they expire.

Cert Manager can obtain certificates from various certificate authorities, including: Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, and private PKI.

When installing the extension, enabling parameters under the `defaultIssuer` field in the extension configuration will generate a ClusterIssuer named `default-issuer`. The default ClusterIssuer can be used to issue certificates for other components. For example, when using the KubeSphere Gateway, it can automatically generate and update certificates for ingresses.
