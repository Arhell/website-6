This section introduces how to enable network isolation for workspaces and projects.

The network isolation feature is used to control the egress and ingress traffic of pods in a workspace and project. You can use the network isolation feature to achieve the following:

* Allow pods in the current workspace and project to access only specific other pods or network segments.

* Allow pods in the current workspace and project to be accessed only by specific other pods or network segments.

Enabling workspace network isolation will automatically create network policies for all projects under the workspace in the corresponding cluster. If a new project is added to the workspace, a network policy will be automatically created for the project. If a project is removed from the workspace, the network policy for the project will also be automatically removed.

Enabling project network isolation will automatically create a network policy for the project in the corresponding cluster.
