The OAuth2-Proxy extension is designed to protect backend applications and provide a unified authentication service. By handling the OAuth2 protocol authentication process, it allows users to log in through third-party authentication services (such as Google, GitHub, KubeSphere) and generate user sessions. link:https://openresty.org/[OpenResty] serves as a reverse proxy server, receiving HTTP requests and forwarding them to backend applications.

OAuth2-Proxy provides a unified authentication interface to ensure that all applications are protected through the same process, simplifying identity verification management in multi-application environments, enhancing security and user experience. It is suitable for enterprise environments that require unified authentication management for multiple backend applications, as well as applications that need user identity verification through third-party authentication services.
