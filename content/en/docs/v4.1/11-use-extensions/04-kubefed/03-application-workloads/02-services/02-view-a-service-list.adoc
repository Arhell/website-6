include::../../../../../_custom-en/clusterManagement/services/services-para-name.adoc[]

|Status
|The status of the service, either **Running** or **Deleting**.

|Service Type
|The type of the service. Depending on how the service is created, {ks_product-en} categorizes services into the following types:

include::../../../../../_custom-en/clusterManagement/services/services-para-statelessStatefulExternal.adoc[]

// * **External Service**: The service forwards business traffic to other services outside the cluster. The system does not allocate a virtual IP address to the service, and it can be accessed from within the cluster using a domain name in the format <service name>.<project name>**.svc.cluster.local**.

// * **Custom Service**: A service created by the user by customizing the internal access mode and backend workload.

|App
|The app to which the service belongs.

// |Internal Access
