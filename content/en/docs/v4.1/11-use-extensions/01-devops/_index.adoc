DevOps supports deploying and managing CI/CD tasks and related workloads on Kubernetes clusters. When installing DevOps, Jenkins will be automatically deployed to support pipeline building through Jenkinsfile. Additionally, DevOps provides a graphical editing panel to visualize the entire process, presenting the running status of the pipeline at each stage intuitively.

After installing DevOps, **DevOps Projects** will appear in the left navigation pane of the workspace.

This section explains how to manage DevOps projects and operate within DevOps projects, including running pipelines, creating credentials, and integrating tools.
