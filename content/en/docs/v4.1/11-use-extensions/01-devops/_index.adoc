DevOps supports deploying and managing CI/CD tasks and related workloads on Kubernetes clusters. When installing DevOps, Jenkins will be automatically deployed to support pipeline building through Jenkinsfile. Additionally, DevOps provides a graphical editing panel to visualize the entire process, presenting the running status of the pipeline at each stage intuitively.

After installing DevOps, **DevOps Projects** will appear in the left navigation pane of the workspace.

This section explains how to manage DevOps projects in a workspace and operate within DevOps projects, including running pipelines, creating credentials, and integrating tools.
