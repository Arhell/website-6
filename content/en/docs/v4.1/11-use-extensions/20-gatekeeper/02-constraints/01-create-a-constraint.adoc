|Parameter |Description

|Constraint Name
|The name of the constraint.

|Constraint Kind
|The constraint template used by the constraint.

|Enforcement Action
|The `enforcementAction` field defines the action for handling Constraint violations. The default setting is `deny`, which means that by default, any admission request that violates the constraint will be denied. For more information, see link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/violations/[Handling Constraint Violations].

|Match Kinds
|The `match` field defines the resources to which the constraint applies. For more information, see link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/#the-match-field[match].

`kinds` accepts a list of objects with `apiGroups` and `kinds` fields that list the groups/kinds of objects to which the constraint will apply. If multiple groups/kinds objects are specified, only one match is needed for the resource to be in scope.

|Namespace Selector
|It is a label selector against an object's containing namespace or the object itself, if the object is a namespace.

|Parameters
|It describes the intent of a constraint. For more information, see link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/#the-parameters-field[parameters].
|===

You will view the created constraint on the **Constraints** page.
