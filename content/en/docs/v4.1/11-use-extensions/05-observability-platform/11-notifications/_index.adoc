This section describes how to use the "WhizardTelemetry Notification" extension.

This extension is used to manage notifications in multi-tenant Kubernetes environments. It can receive alerts, cloud events, and other types of events (such as audits and Kubernetes events) from different senders, and send notifications to the corresponding tenant receivers based on tenant labels (such as namespaces or users). It supports multiple notification channels such as email, Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, Slack, and Webhook.


After installing the "WhizardTelemetry Notification" extension,

* The **Notification Management** option will be displayed under the left navigation pane of platform settings.
* The **Log Receivers** option will be displayed under the **Cluster Settings** menu on the left navigation pane of the cluster, and the **Log Receivers** page will display the **Notification History** tab, supporting adding various types of log receivers. For more information, see link:../02-logging/06-log-receivers/[Log Receivers].

- WhizardTelemetry Notification has been changed from being deployed on each cluster to only needing to be deployed on the host cluster. An `alertmanager proxy` has been added to the host cluster and exposed in NodePort (default 31093). When configuring WhizardTelemetry Alerting and WhizardTelemetry Events Alerting, if using the WhizardTelemetry Notification extension to send alert messages, corresponding configurations are required. For more information, see link:../06-alerting[WhizardTelemetry Alerting] and link:../09-events-altering[WhizardTelemetry Events Alerting].

- WhizardTelemetry Notification depends on WhizardTelemetry Platform Service and WhizardTelemetry Data Pipeline, so before installing WhizardTelemetry Notification, the WhizardTelemetry Platform Service and WhizardTelemetry Data Pipeline extensions must be installed and configured first, otherwise, the notification-related functions cannot be used normally!
