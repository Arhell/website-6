This section describes how to use the alerting feature.

Alerts are generated by the system based on alerting rule groups. When the metrics set in the alerting rule group meet the preset conditions and duration, the system will generate an alert. When the metrics no longer meet the preset conditions, the alert will be automatically cleared by the system.
