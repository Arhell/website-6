This section introduces how to create, edit, enable, disable, and view alert rule groups in clusters and projects.

After creating a rule group, the system can generate alerts when specific monitoring metrics meet preset conditions and durations.

- {ks_product-en} provides built-in rule groups for clusters, and also supports custom rule groups. If the Whizard Observability Center is enabled, built-in rule groups can only be managed in the Whizard Observability Center. For more information, see link:../../07-whizard/05-alert-management/01-rule-groups/[Whizard Rule Groups].

- In projects, only custom rule groups are supported.
