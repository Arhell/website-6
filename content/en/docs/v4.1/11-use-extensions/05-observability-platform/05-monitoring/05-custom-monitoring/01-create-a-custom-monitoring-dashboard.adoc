include::../../../../../_custom-en/clusterManagement/clusterManagement-prer-requiredPermission_clusterandproject.adoc[]

include::../../../../../_custom-en/clusterManagement/customMonitoringDashboards/customMonitoringDashboards-prer-exposeMetrics.adoc[]

* You should set up a monitoring exporter on the service exposing the workload to declare the path providing application monitoring metrics. KubeSphere will get the application's monitoring metrics based on the relevant parameters of the monitoring exporter. For more information, see link:../../08-edit-a-metrics-exporter/[Edit a Metrics Exporter].

== Steps

. Log in to the {ks_product-en} web console with a user who has the pass:a,q[{ks_permission}] permission and enter your cluster or project.
