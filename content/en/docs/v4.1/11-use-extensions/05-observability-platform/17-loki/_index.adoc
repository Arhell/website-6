Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. By collecting, indexing, and storing log data, it allows users to easily search, query, and visualize log information. Loki supports storing logs in object storage and querying logs from it, making it a good choice for low-cost storage of large volumes of logs.

The Grafana Loki for WhizardTelemetry extension allows viewing logs, audits, events, and notification history data of KubeSphere stored in Loki in the Grafana console.
