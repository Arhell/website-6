This section briefly introduces how to add, configure, and query data sources. For more information, see link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/[Grafana data sources].

Before creating a Dashboard, you must first add a data source. The Grafana for WhizardTelemetry extension defaults to adding the Prometheus server address as a data source. You can also add data sources yourself, such as Loki, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

After adding a data source, you can:

- Use Explore to query data.
- Visualize data in panels.
- Create alert rules.

== Prerequisites

Only users with the admin role in the Grafana console can add or delete data sources.

== Add Data Sources

. After logging into the Grafana console, click **Connections** in the left navigation pane.
. Search for the data source, such as `loki`.
. Click the data source name to enter the data source overview page.
. Click **Add new data source** in the upper-right corner to enter the data source configuration page.
. Enter the server address of the data source, then click **Save & test** at the bottom to complete the configuration of the data source.

== Query Data Source Data

Set query conditions to query data for specific metrics within a certain time range in the data source.

. Click **Explore** in the left navigation pane, and select the data source at the top.
. Enter or select **Metric** in the query editor, set **Label filters**, then click **Run query** in the upper-right corner.
