After adding a data source, create a Dashboard to visualize the data from the data source.

A Dashboard consists of one or more panels, organized and arranged in rows. Panels display data and provide various control options.

This section briefly introduces how to create a Dashboard. For more information, see link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/[Grafana dashboards].

== Steps

. Click **Dashboards** in the left navigation pane of the Grafana console.
. Click **New > New Dashboard**.
. On the blank Dashboard page, click **+ Add visualization**.
. In the pop-up dialog, select the added data source, and the panel editing page will automatically open.

.. Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/refresh-light.png[refresh-light,18,18] to query data.

.. Click the chart type on the right (such as Time series) to select a chart style. The data will be displayed in this style.

.. In the **Panel options** area, set the panel's name, description, etc.

.. After editing, click **Apply** to save the panel, and click **Save** to save the Dashboard.

When saving the Dashboard, you can set the Dashboard's name, description, and directory.

. On the newly created Dashboard page, click **Add** at the top, select **Visualization**, and continue to add panels.

. After exiting the panel editing page, you can drag the panel title to move it to any position; drag the cursor at the bottom right of the panel to adjust the size of the panel in the Dashboard.

. Click the save button at the top of the Dashboard page to save the Dashboard again.

At this point, a Dashboard with multiple panels is created.
