This section describes how to use the "WhizardTelemetry Events Alerting" extension.

WhizardTelemetry Events Alerting supports audit alerting, event alerting, and log alerting features. It allows defining alert rules for Kubernetes/KubeSphere audit events, Kubernetes native events, and Kubernetes logs, evaluates incoming event and log data, and sends alerts to specified receivers such as HTTP endpoints.

Among them, log alerting supports keyword-based alerting and sliding window alerting.

- Keyword-based alerting: Triggers an alert when a specific keyword appears in the logs.

- Sliding window alerting: Triggers an alert when the amount of log data meeting the conditions reaches a user-specified number within a sliding time window.
