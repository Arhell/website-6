The "OpenSearch Distributed Search and Analytics Engine" extension is a built-in log storage extension for KubeSphere, used to store observability data such as logs, audits, events, and notification history.

In addition to supporting the deployment of OpenSearch, this extension also supports the deployment of OpenSearch Dashboard and OpenSearch Curator.

* **OpenSearch Dashboard** is used for visualizing OpenSearch data and managing the OpenSearch cluster's user interface. It is disabled by default after deployment. To enable it, set the `opensearch-dashboards.enabled` field to `true`.

* **OpenSearch Curator** is a CronJob that periodically cleans up Kubernetes event logs, Kubernetes audit logs, Kubernetes application logs, and notification history logs that exceed the configured date (default is 7 days). It is enabled by default after deployment. To disable it, set the `opensearch-curator.enabled` field to `false`.
