|Note

|
{ks_product-en} only supports creating custom rule groups, not built-in rule groups.
|===

== Prerequisites

* You should have the **platform-admin** role on the {ks_product-en} platform. For more information, see link:../../../../../../05-users-and-roles/01-users/[Users] and link:../../../../../../05-users-and-roles/02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

* To monitor the metrics of applications, you need to configure the applications running in containers to expose monitoring metrics that comply with the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/[Prometheus specification] at a certain service endpoint, and set up a monitoring exporter on the service that exposes the workload to declare the path providing application monitoring metrics. For more information, see link:../../../../05-monitoring/08-edit-a-metrics-exporter/[Edit a Metrics Exporter].
