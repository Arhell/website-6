This section describes how to use the alerting feature in the Whizard Observability Center.

The **Built-in Alerts** and **Custom Alerts** pages in the Whizard Observability Center display global alerts generated by the system based on global **Built-in Rule Groups** and global **Custom Rule Groups**. When the metrics set in the global alerting rule groups meet the preset conditions and duration, the system will generate alerts. When the metrics no longer meet the preset conditions, the alerts will be automatically cleared by the system.
