This section describes how to create, edit, enable, disable, and view global alerting rule groups in the Whizard Observability Center.

You can create global alerting rule groups on the rule groups page of the Whizard Observability Center. Unlike rule groups created by users in clusters and projects, global rules can be used to monitor resources across all clusters managed by the platform. The **Built-in Rule Groups** page of the Whizard Observability Center provides built-in rule groups, and the **Custom Rule Groups** page supports creating rule groups. Rule groups allow the system to generate alerts when specific monitoring metrics meet preset conditions and duration.
