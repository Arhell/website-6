As an open-source service mesh solution, link:https://istio.io/[Istio] provides powerful traffic management capabilities for microservices. The **KubeSphere Service Mesh** extension integrates Istio, providing users with a consistent microservice management experience.

This section demonstrates how to deploy the sample application `Bookinfo`, which consists of four independent microservices, and how to access the application via NodePort.


== Bookinfo Introduction

The application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

- **productpage**. The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
- **details**. The `details` microservice contains book information.
- **reviews**. The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice.
- **ratings**. The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the **reviews** microservice:

- Version v1 doesnâ€™t call the `ratings` service.
- Version v2 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
- Version v3 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below. For more details, please refer to link:https://istio.io/latest/zh/docs/examples/bookinfo/[Bookinfo Application].

== Prerequisites

* Prepare a project (e.g., **demo-project**) and a user (e.g., **project-regular**). The user should have been invited to the project and has the **operator** role in it. For more information, please refer to link:../04-control-user-permissions/[Control User Permissions].

* **KubeSphere Service Mesh** and **KubeSphere Gateway** should have been installed and enabled.

* Enable the project gateway and enable the **Tracing** function for the project gateway. For more information, please refer to link:../../11-use-extensions/12-gateway/01-project-gateway/01-enable-a-project-gateway[Enable Project Gateway].
endif::[]

* Enable the project gateway and enable the **Tracing** function for the project gateway. For more information, please refer to the "Enable Project Gateway" section in the {ks_product-en} Extension User Guide.

If you cannot access the Ingress after enabling tracing, please add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: true` to the Ingress.

== Steps

=== 1. Deploy Bookinfo

. Log in to the {ks_product-en} web console as the **project-regular** user, click **Workspace Management**, enter the workspace where the project is located, and click **demo-project** in the project list.

. In the left navigation pane, select **Service Mesh** > **Composed AppS**, and click **Deploy Sample App** on the right side.

. Click **Next** in the dialog box that appears. The **Service Settings** tab is pre-filled with the required fields for the four deployments (productpage, reviews, details, ratings), and you do not need to modify the settings. Just click **Create** on the **Ingress Settings** tab.

=== 2. Verify if Bookinfo is Deployed Successfully

In the left navigation pane, select **Application Workloads** > **Workloads**, and check the running status of these four deployments on the **Deployments** tab. If the status is **Running**, it indicates that the Bookinfo application has been deployed successfully.

=== 3. Access Bookinfo via NodePort

. In the left navigation pane, select **Application Workloads** > **Services**.

. Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg[more,18,18] on the right side of `productpage`, and select **Edit External Access**.

. Select **NodePort** in **Access Mode**, and click **OK**.

. Click **productpage** to enter the details page, and you can view the exposed node port in the **Ports** area under the **Resource Status** tab.

. Enter `<Node IP>:<Node Port>` in the browser to access Bookinfo from outside the cluster, as shown below.

Depending on the deployment environment of your Kubernetes cluster, you may need to open the port in the security group and configure port forwarding rules.

. Click **Normal user** at the bottom left of the page to view the complete Bookinfo page.

The left Book Details is provided by the `details` microservice, and the right Book Reviews is provided by the `reviews` microservice. Only Reviewer1 and Reviewer2 appear, and there is no rating (`ratings`) because the v1 version of the `reviews` microservice does not call the `ratings` service.

If you want to call the `ratings` service and explore more traffic management functions, you can perform a link:../07-canary-release-example/[Canary Release] for this application.
