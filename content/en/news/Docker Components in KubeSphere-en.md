Beijing QingCloud Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "QingCloud" or "the Company") adheres to the principles of openness and transparency in cooperation, committed to providing users with secure and compliant cloud-native product solutions. To safeguard user rights and clarify product responsibilities, the Company hereby issues the following official statement regarding the product information and Docker component compliance of the KubeSphere container management platform (hereinafter referred to as "the Platform"):

## I. Product Positioning and Technical Architecture
The KubeSphere container management platform is an enterprise-grade container cluster orchestration and management platform independently developed by QingCloud. Built on open-source Kubernetes technology, the Platform specializes in delivering efficient and stable containerized application deployment, operation, maintenance, and full lifecycle management services for global users. It is designed for complex scenarios including hybrid cloud, heterogeneous multi-cloud, and edge computing.

## II. Scope of Application
This statement on Docker component compliance in the KubeSphere container management platform applies to the following product versions:

- KubeSphere Open Source Edition.
- KubeSphere Enterprise Edition (including the previously named QingCloud QKCP).

## III. Copyright and Docker Component Compliance Statement
**1. Platform Component Composition**
  - The Platform is a server-side software, and its technical implementation and deliverables strictly comply with open-source licensing specifications.
  - **Docker Desktop software or any components introduced via Docker Desktop are not included** in the software installation packages provided by the Company or in end-user runtime environments.

**2. Compliance of Docker Component Usage**
- Docker Community Edition (docker-ce) and Docker Engine integrated into the Platform’s software installation packages are directly downloaded from official Docker channels (via the standalone paths listed on Docker’s official website). In accordance with the copyright notice published on Docker’s official documentation (available at https://docs.docker.com/engine/), these components are explicitly stated to be licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
- The Company’s integration of these components fully complies with the requirements of the Apache License 2.0. **No technical components are obtained through Docker Desktop,** and thus the integration is** not subject to the restrictions described under "commercial use of Docker Engine obtained via Docker Desktop"**, fully aligning with Docker’s official regulations.

**3. User Autonomy**
- The use of Docker components (e.g., docker-ce) integrated into the Platform’s software installation packages **is optional and determined solely by users based on their requirements.**
- The Company provides multiple container runtime solutions, including Docker Community Edition (docker-ce) and containerd, allowing users to select solutions that best meet their operational needs. Architectural consultation and delivery services are also available.
- **Users who independently install Docker Desktop in their environments assume full legal responsibility** for any compliance disputes arising from such actions.

## IV. User Support and Collaboration
QingCloud prioritizes user trust above all. For any inquiries regarding this statement, technical details, or collaboration opportunities, please contact our professional team via:
